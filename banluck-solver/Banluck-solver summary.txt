Banluck Solver — Project Summary

  What it is: A Game Theory Optimal (GTO) solver for Banluck (Chinese Blackjack), a variant of Blackjack played across Southeast Asia. The
  goal is to compute optimal strategies and quantify the house edge under different dealer rule variants.

  Tech stack: Python, NumPy, Numba (JIT), Plotly, pytest.

  Key rules that differ from standard Blackjack:
  - Ace valuation changes based on hand size (2-card vs 3+-card)
  - Dealer hard-15 surrender → push (overrides everything, including Ban Ban)
  - Player ≤15 forfeit → unconditional loss (even on dealer bust)
  - Special hands with bonus payouts: Ban Ban (3:1), Ban Luck (2:1), 777 (7:1), Five-card 21 (3:1), Five-card <21 (2:1)
  - Dealer optional "selective reveal" mechanic at 16/17 — modelled as an explicit strategic node

  Solver architecture (all complete):
  1. Game engine — pure rule logic (cards, deck, hand totals, special hand detection, settlement)
  2. DP Baseline Solver — infinite-deck backward induction; two modes (reveal ON/OFF); EV delta ~+0.84% from selective reveal
  3. CFR+ Solver — counterfactual regret minimisation with Numba JIT (~6.7 ms/pass); models dealer reveal as an explicit action node; finds
  Nash equilibrium strategies
  4. Monte Carlo Simulator — real-deck cross-validation; real-deck baseline EVs: reveal_off ≈ −4.71%, reveal_on ≈ −3.75%
  5. Analysis layer — strategy reports, heat maps (Plotly), Q&A research functions

  Current status: 632 tests passing. Phase 3 in progress — next tasks are an interactive Plotly lookup tool, variance/bankroll analysis, and
  remaining research questions (Q2, Q5).

  Looking for: Agents, skills, or tools to help with data visualisation (Plotly dashboards), game theory analysis, Monte Carlo simulation, or
   Python performance optimisation.
